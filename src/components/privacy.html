                We build a range of services that help millions of people daily
                to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services
                include:

                <li>
                  Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system

                You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your
                privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if
                you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or
                see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google
                services when youâ€™re signed out or without creating an account
                at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You
                can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome
                Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from
                other people who use your device. And across our services, you
                can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect
                some types of data and how we use it.

                We collect information to provide better services to all our
                users â€” from figuring out basic stuff like which language you
                speak, to more complex things like which ads youâ€™ll find most
                useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which
                YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects,
                and how that information is used, depends on how you use our
                services and how you manage your privacy controls.

                When youâ€™re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the
                information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the
                browser, application, or device youâ€™re using. This allows us to
                do things like maintain your preferences across browsing
                sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you
                more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.
              </p>
              <p>
                When youâ€™re signed in, we also collect information that we store

                choose to add a phone number or payment information to your
                account. Even if you arenâ€™t signed in to a Google Account, you
                might choose to provide us with information â€” like an email
                address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our
                services.

                We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from

                videos.

                We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you
                use to access Google services, which helps us provide features
                like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your
                battery runs low.
              </p>
              <p>
                The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser
                type and settings, device type and settings, operating system,
                mobile network information including carrier name and phone
                number, and application version number. We also collect
                information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and
                devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports,
                system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your
                request.

              <p>
                We collect this information when a Google service on your device
                contacts our servers â€” for example, when you install an app from
                the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates.
                If youâ€™re using an Android device with Google apps, your device
                periodically contacts Google servers to provide information
                about your device and connection to our services. This
                information includes things like your
                <span class="text-secondary-base">
                  device type and carrier name </span
                >, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on
                your device settings,
                <span class="text-secondary-base">
                  other information about how youâ€™re using your Android device </span

                If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and

                We collect location information when you use our services, which
                helps us offer features like driving directions, search results

                Depending on the products youâ€™re using and settings you choose,
                Google may use different types of location information to help
                make some services and products you use more helpful. These
                include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>GPS and other sensor data from your device</li>
                <li>IP address</li>
                <li>
                  Activity on Google services, such as from your searches or
                  places you label like home or work
                </li>
                <li>
                  Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi
                  access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices

                The types of location data we collect and how long we store it
                depend in part on your device and account settings. For example,
                you can
                <span class="text-secondary-base"
                  >turn your Android deviceâ€™s location on or off</span
                >
                using the deviceâ€™s settings app. You can also turn on
                <span class="text-secondary-base"> Location History </span> if
                you want to create a private map of where you go with your
                signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is
                enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services,
                which may also include location information, is saved to your
                Google Account. Learn more about

                In some circumstances, Google also collects information about
                you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name
                appears in your local newspaper, Googleâ€™s Search engine may
                index that article and display it to other people if they search
                for your name. We may also collect information about you from
                trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with
                business information to be displayed on Googleâ€™s services,
                marketing partners who provide us with information about
                potential customers of our business services, and security
                partners who provide us with information to protect against
                abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide
                advertising and research services on their behalf.
